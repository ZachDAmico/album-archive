## Description of the user types
The user of this application is an individual who has a passion for record collecting and listening to their records. Searching by the info on the spine of each record can be tedious, so to save time(any maybe even refresh their memory), they can quickly and easily skim through their collection to find a record they'd like to listen to. If they're feeling particularly indecisive, they can have the application randomly generate a selection for them.
